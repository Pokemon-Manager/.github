What is Pok√©mon Manager?
-
Pok√©mon Manager is designed to be the ultimate toolset for managing your Pok√©mon in an effient and simple way. This project is a refactored and redesigned version of the previous repo of the same name.

Why are there multiple repos?
-
Spliting all of the features of Pok√©mon Manager into different repos was done due to three key reasons:
  1. Avoidance against push conflicts.
  2. Allows the creation of separate tools to be created for single use cases, and to also add functionality to the already great [PKHeX](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX).
  3. Me. This is my first official project, so I am still learning a lot, and spliting the project into repos seems like a good idea.
